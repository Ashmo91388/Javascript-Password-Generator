# Javascript-Password-Generator

## Description
I have created a password generator for the end user to access sensitive data. 
A random password (that meets specific criteria) automatically generates, so that
the end user is provided with a strong password for better security. 

### **List of Features**
My first action was to define generatePassword function that was provided in the starter code - line 9 a console log was added to test my feautre and to indicate that something has happened, although not rendered yet. A return function was placed in this scope as a placeholder for the random generated password.

After, I began to pusedo code to start planning the structure of this project. This is when the acceptance critera is followed.
